# BENMATH
A python script that uses hexadecimals to go up to base 35
### Made to solve a funny math problem: </br>
To get the echo of a positive integer, we write it twice in a row without a space. </br>
For example, the echo of 2023 is 20232023. Is there a positive integer whose echo is a perfect square? </br>
If so, how many such positive integers can you find? If not, explain why not. </br>

### How does it work?
This script goes and checkes every single number from 0-500billion from base 2 to base 35. </br>
Read the code, it's somewhat self explanatory.
